# E-Commerce-Shipping-Prediction : Overview
* Shipment punctuality prediction. Dataset acquired from  [E-Commerce Shipping Data | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/prachi13/customer-analytics)
* Use Log Transform to transform features with outliers
* No Sampling on target column (pretty balanced)
* Trained model with 3 different algorithms
* Use Hyperparameter tuning on each algorithm
* etc

## Problem
Anterin Dong is an Indonesian e-commerce company that has its own shipment service. There are 3 shipment mode available: Flight, Ship, and Road. The company's motto is "Your order is our happiness, and your happiness is our pride‚Äù. <br>
Now as things stand, Anterin Dong has a 59.6% late shipment rate which means the majority of the shipment is arriving late. This is obviously a problem.

## Goals
We want to <b>minimize the possibility of late shipment </b> so that the late shipment rate could drop at least by 20%.

## Objective
Create a model to predict the shipment arrival; so that the company knows which products is going to arrive late.

## Insights
1. Target column distribution is imbalanced, but still acceptable.<br>

0 = On time; 1 = Late. As we can see the target distribution is slightly imbalanced, with 1 or Late being the majority.

2. Some interesting correlation from the 'Discount_offered' column and 'Product_weight' towards the target column.<br>

We can see from the first graph that the higher the discount, the shipment is always late.<br>
From the second graph however, the heavier the product, the shipment tend to be on time. <br>
From the third graph we can look at them more clearly:

* Products that arrived on time has the discount value in range of 0%-10%. Other than that, the shipments are always late.
* The weights of the products that arrived on time are in range of 1-2 kg or 4-6 kg. Other than those, the shipments are late.
