## Problem
Anterin Dong is an Indonesian e-commerce company, which has its own shipment service. There are 3 shipment mode available: Flight, Ship, and Road. The company's motto is "Your order is our happiness, and your happiness is our pride‚Äù. <br>
Now as things stand, Anterin Dong has a 59.6% late shipment rate which means the majority of the shipment is arriving late. This is obviously a problem.

## Goals
We want to <b>minimize the possibility of late shipment </b> so that the late shipment rate could drop at least by 20%.

## Objective
Create a model to predict the shipment arrival; so that the company knows which products is going to arrive late.
